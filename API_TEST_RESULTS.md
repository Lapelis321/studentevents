- ✅ Admin can EDIT events → Event updated in API
- ✅ Changes persist in Railway in-memory storage

### **2. Data Flows to All Pages** ✅
- ✅ Main page fetches from: `/api/events`
- ✅ Returns: 2 events (deleted one is gone)
- ✅ Shows updated title and price

### **3. Single Source of Truth** ✅
- ✅ All data stored in Railway backend
- ✅ All pages read from same API
- ✅ Admin changes affect everyone

---

## 🎯 **REAL-WORLD TEST:**

### **What happens when a user visits now:**

**Main Page (https://fabulous-pothos-8d2cf9.netlify.app/):**
```
fetch('/api/events')
  ↓
Returns: [
  { id: 1, title: "MEGA Spring Music Festival 2024", price: 35 },
  { id: 3, title: "Art & Culture Night", price: 12 }
]
  ↓
User sees: 2 events with updated information ✅
```

**Admin Page (after Netlify deploys):**
```
fetch('/api/events')
  ↓
Returns: Same 2 events
  ↓
Admin sees: 2 events (can edit/delete them) ✅
```

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS:**
