# üö® CRITICAL FIXES - DO THESE NOW

## Problem Summary

Your production site is showing **wrong data** because:
1. **IPv6 Connection Issue**: Railway cannot connect to Supabase database (IPv6 incompatibility)
2. **Security Warnings**: Supabase showing RLS and function security errors

---

## üî¥ PRIORITY 1: Fix Database Connection (CRITICAL)

**Symptoms:**
- Admin panel shows 4 events
- Main page shows 6 events
- Wrong event states displayed

**Root Cause:** Railway is using old in-memory data because it can't connect to Supabase via IPv6.

### **Steps to Fix:**

#### **Step 1: Get IPv4 Connection String from Supabase**

1. **Open:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu/settings/database

2. **Scroll down to "Connection string" section**

3. **You'll see these tabs:**
   ```
   [ URI ]  [ Session mode ]  [ Transaction mode ]
   ```

4. **Click "Session mode" tab** ‚Üê IMPORTANT!

5. **Copy the connection string** - it looks like:
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```

6. **Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]`** with: `Sangilapas26ISM`

   **Final string should be:**
   ```
   postgresql://postgres.vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu:Sangilapas26ISM@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
   ```

   **‚ö†Ô∏è KEY DIFFERENCE:**
   - ‚ùå OLD (doesn't work): `db.vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu.supabase.co` (IPv6)
   - ‚úÖ NEW (works): `aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com` (IPv4)

#### **Step 2: Update Railway**

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Click** your "studentevents" project

3. **Click** the service (should be the only one)

4. **Click** "Variables" tab at the top

5. **Find** `DATABASE_URL` in the list

6. **Click** the `DATABASE_URL` line to edit it

7. **Delete** the old value completely

8. **Paste** the new Session mode connection string

9. **Click** outside the box or press Enter to save

10. **Railway will automatically redeploy** (~30 seconds)

#### **Step 3: Verify Fix**

Wait 30 seconds, then test:

```
https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/events
```

**Expected Result:**
- Should return **3 events** (same as admin panel)
- Events should have correct statuses:
  - Summer Beach Party: `completed-shown`
  - Tech Startup Night: `active`
  - Electronic Music Festival: `sold-out`

**Then check your website:**
- https://afterstateevents.netlify.app
- Admin panel and main page should show **same 3 events**

## üü° PRIORITY 2: Fix Security Warnings (IMPORTANT)

**What:** Supabase is showing 2 security warnings that need to be fixed.

### **Step 1: Run Security Fix Script**

1. **Open:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu/sql/new

2. **Copy the entire contents** of this file:
   ```
   backend/supabase-security-fix.sql
   ```

3. **Paste into Supabase SQL Editor**

4. **Click "Run"** (bottom right)

5. **You should see:** "Success. No rows returned" (this is good!)

### **Step 2: Verify Security Fix**

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu/database/linter

2. **Check for errors:**
   - ‚úÖ Should see **0 ERRORS**
   - ‚úÖ Should see **0 WARNINGS** (or significantly fewer)

## üìä What These Fixes Do

### **IPv6 ‚Üí IPv4 Connection Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Railway backend connects to Supabase database successfully
- ‚úÖ All data syncs properly between frontend and backend
- ‚úÖ Admin changes reflect immediately on main site
- ‚úÖ No more stale in-memory data

### **Security Hardening:**
- ‚úÖ **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
  - Protects against unauthorized access
  - Supabase requirement for production databases
  
- ‚úÖ **Function Search Path** fixed
  - Prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities
  - Secures database triggers

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Required

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Get Supabase connection string | 2 minutes |
| Update Railway DATABASE_URL | 1 minute |
| Wait for redeploy | 30 seconds |
| Verify fix | 1 minute |
| Run security SQL script | 2 minutes |
| Verify security | 1 minute |
| **TOTAL** | **~8 minutes** |

## üéØ Success Checklist

After completing both fixes:

- [x] Railway backend connects to database (no errors in logs)
- [x] API returns 3 events (not 4 or 6)
- [x] Admin panel shows 3 events
- [x] Main page shows 3 events
- [x] Event statuses are correct
- [x] Supabase security advisor shows 0 errors
- [x] Supabase security advisor shows 0 warnings

## üÜò If Something Goes Wrong

### Railway shows errors after update:
1. Check the connection string format is correct
2. Make sure password is correct: `Sangilapas26ISM`
3. Make sure you used **Session mode** tab (not URI or Transaction mode)

### Supabase SQL script fails:
1. The script is safe to run multiple times
2. It will drop and recreate policies/functions
3. Share the exact error message if issues persist

### Still seeing 6 events on main page:
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check Railway deployment finished
3. Verify API endpoint returns correct data

## üìû Next Steps After Fixing

Once these critical issues are resolved, you can:
1. Set up SendGrid for email notifications (TODO #9)
2. Test the complete purchase flow (TODO #12)
3. Go live with confidence! üöÄ

## üí° Technical Explanation (Optional Reading)

**Why IPv6 Doesn't Work on Railway:**
- Supabase recently switched to IPv6-only direct connections
- Railway's infrastructure doesn't support IPv6 yet
- Supabase's connection pooler (Supavisor) supports both IPv4 and IPv6
- The "Session mode" connection string uses the pooler (IPv4 compatible)

**Why RLS Matters:**
- Row Level Security is PostgreSQL's way of controlling data access
- Supabase requires RLS for production databases
- Without RLS, Supabase considers your tables vulnerable
- RLS works alongside your backend JWT authentication

**Why search_path Matters:**
- PostgreSQL functions can be vulnerable to "search path injection"
- Malicious users could create objects in other schemas
- Setting a fixed search_path prevents this attack vector
- It's a PostgreSQL security best practice
