5. All pages reflect changes immediately
```

## üìä DATA PERSISTENCE - VERIFIED FIXES

### **Event Edit Persistence (CRITICAL FIX):**
```
BEFORE:
  - Edit event ‚Üí save ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí changes revert ‚ùå
  - Cause: parseInt(UUID) converted to NaN

AFTER:
  - Edit event ‚Üí save ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí changes persist ‚úÖ
  - Fix: Use req.params.id directly for UUIDs
  - Verified: Line 337, 391 in railway-server.js
```

### **Filter Persistence:**
```
BEFORE:
  - Select filters ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí resets to default ‚ùå

AFTER:
  - Select filters ‚Üí refresh ‚Üí filters remain ‚úÖ
  - Storage: localStorage
  - Keys: bookingEventFilter, bookingStatusFilter
  - Restored on page load
```

### **Auto-Refresh Bookings:**
```
ACTIVE:
  - Polls API every 10 seconds
  - Only when on Bookings tab
  - Stops when switching tabs
  - Console logs: "üîÑ Auto-refreshing bookings..."
  - Real-time updates without manual refresh
```

---
