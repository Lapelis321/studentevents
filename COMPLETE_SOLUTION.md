# 🚨 COMPLETE SOLUTION - Two Issues to Fix

## Issue 1: Database Still Has Wrong Data ❌

**Current API Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "778b1766-4842-48c4-a423-74b9faa27891",
  "title": "Fux After Party", 
  "min_age": null,                    // ❌ STILL NULL
  "dress_code": "No specific dress code"  // ❌ STILL WRONG
}
```

**Fix: Use Admin Dashboard (FASTEST)**
1. Go to: https://afterstateevents.vercel.app/admin
2. Login: admin@studentevents.com / admin123
3. Go to Events tab
4. Click "Edit" on "Fux After Party"
5. Set:
   - Minimum Age: "18"
   - Dress Code: "Studio 54"
6. Click "Save Changes"

## Issue 2: Frontend Not Updated Yet ❌

**Current Status:**
- Frontend shows: `homepage.js?v=4.1.0` (old version)
- Should show: `homepage.js?v=4.2.0` (new version with 24-hour format)

**Fix: Wait for Vercel Deployment**
- Vercel is still deploying the latest changes
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Then refresh the page to get the new version

## 🎯 Complete Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Update Database (CRITICAL)
Use the admin dashboard to edit the "Fux After Party" event:
- Set Minimum Age to "18"
- Set Dress Code to "Studio 54"
- Save changes

### Step 2: Wait for Frontend Deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to deploy v4.2.0
- The new version will have 24-hour format fixes

### Step 3: Verify Results
After both steps:
- Main page should show "18+ years" instead of "undefined+ years"
- Main page should show "Studio 54" instead of "undefined"
- All times should show 24-hour format (18:30 instead of 6:30 PM)

## 🚀 Expected Final Result:

| Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "undefined+ years" | "18+ years" |
| "undefined" | "Studio 54" |
| "6:30 PM" | "18:30" |

**Both the database update AND the frontend deployment are needed to completely fix all issues!**
