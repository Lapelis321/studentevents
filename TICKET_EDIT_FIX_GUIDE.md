# ✅ TICKET EDIT ISSUE - SOLVED

## Problem Identified

**User Report:** "When the number of tickets is edited, it comes back to default"

### Root Cause
The ticket editing was failing because **users were not properly authenticated**. The admin dashboard requires a valid JWT token to save changes to the database.

**What was happening:**
1. User opens admin dashboard directly (without logging in)
2. User edits ticket numbers
3. Frontend tries to save via API with no authentication token
4. API returns 401 "Authentication required"
5. Frontend falls back to localStorage-only save
6. Changes only exist temporarily in browser
7. On page refresh, data loads from API (shows old values)
8. **Result: Edits appear to "revert to default"**

## Solution

### ✅ The Fix is Simple: **LOGIN FIRST**

**Before editing any events, you MUST:**

1. **Go to Admin Login Page**: `http://localhost:8000/admin/login.html`
2. **Login with Admin Credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@studentevents.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. **Then access Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/admin/index.html`
4. **Now ticket edits will persist properly!**

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Login Page → JWT Token → Admin Dashboard → API Calls → Database
```

### Without Authentication
```
User → Admin Dashboard → No Token → API Rejects → localStorage Only → Reverts
```

### With Authentication
```
User → Login → Token → Admin Dashboard → API Success → Database → Persists
```
