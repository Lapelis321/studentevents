# 🎯 Worker Event Assignment Feature Status

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

The worker event assignment feature has been **fully implemented** across all layers:

### 🎨 Frontend Implementation (admin/index.html)

#### Create Worker Modal (Lines 716-721)
```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label class="form-label" for="createWorkerEvent">Assigned Event</label>
    <select class="form-input" id="createWorkerEvent">
        <option value="">No event assigned</option>
    </select>
</div>
```

#### Edit Worker Modal (Lines 782-786)
```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label class="form-label" for="editWorkerEvent">Assigned Event</label>
    <select class="form-input" id="editWorkerEvent">
        <option value="">No event assigned</option>
    </select>
</div>
```

### 🔧 JavaScript Implementation (admin/admin-dashboard.js)

#### Event Dropdown Population
```javascript
populateWorkerEventDropdown(selectId) {
    const eventSelect = document.getElementById(selectId);
    if (!eventSelect) return;
    
    // Clear existing options except "No event assigned"
    eventSelect.innerHTML = '<option value="">No event assigned</option>';
    
    // Add events from this.events array
    this.events.forEach(event => {
        const option = document.createElement('option');
        option.value = event.id;
        option.textContent = event.title;
        eventSelect.appendChild(option);
    });
}
```

#### Create Worker with Event Assignment
```javascript
async saveNewWorker() {
    const name = document.getElementById('createWorkerName').value;
    const email = document.getElementById('createWorkerEmail').value;
    const password = document.getElementById('createWorkerPassword').value;
    const role = document.getElementById('createWorkerRole').value;
    const eventId = document.getElementById('createWorkerEvent')?.value || null; // ✅ Event assignment
    
    const payload = {
        fullName: name,
        email: email,
        password: password,
        role: role,
        eventId: eventId  // ✅ Included in API call
    };
    
    // API call to create worker with event assignment
}
```

#### Edit Worker with Event Assignment
```javascript
async saveEditedWorker() {
    const eventId = document.getElementById('editWorkerEvent')?.value || null; // ✅ Event assignment
    
    const payload = {
        fullName: name,
        email: email,
        role: role,
        eventId: eventId  // ✅ Included in API call
    };
    
    // API call to update worker with event assignment
}
```

### 🚀 Backend Implementation (backend/railway-server.js)

#### Create Worker API (Lines 1487-1519)
```javascript
app.post('/api/admin/workers', verifyAdminToken, async (req, res) => {
    const { fullName, full_name, name, email, password, role, eventId, event_id } = req.body;
    
    const workerName = fullName || full_name || name;
    const workerEventId = eventId || event_id || null; // ✅ Supports event assignment
    
    const result = await pool.query(
        `INSERT INTO workers (full_name, email, password_hash, role, event_id) 
         VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) RETURNING id, full_name, email, role, event_id, created_at`,
        [workerName, email, hashedPassword, role, workerEventId] // ✅ Event ID stored
    );
});
```

#### Update Worker API (Lines 1555-1620)
```javascript
app.put('/api/admin/workers/:id', verifyAdminToken, async (req, res) => {
    const { eventId, event_id, ...otherFields } = req.body;
    const workerEventId = eventId || event_id;
    
    // Build dynamic update query
    if (workerEventId !== undefined) {
        updates.push(`event_id = $${paramCount++}`);
        values.push(workerEventId);
    }
    
    // Execute update with event assignment
});
```

#### Get Workers with Event Info (Lines 1537-1543)
```javascript
app.get('/api/admin/workers', verifyAdminToken, async (req, res) => {
    const result = await pool.query(`
        SELECT 
            w.id, w.full_name, w.email, w.role, w.event_id, w.created_at,
            e.title as event_title  // ✅ Event title included
        FROM workers w
        LEFT JOIN events e ON w.event_id = e.id  // ✅ Join with events table
        ORDER BY w.created_at DESC
    `);
});
```

### 🔐 Security Implementation

#### Worker Token Includes Event Assignment (Lines 1692-1709)
```javascript
const token = jwt.sign(
    {
        workerId: worker.id,
        email: worker.email,
        role: worker.role,
        eventId: worker.event_id  // ✅ Event ID in JWT token
    },
    process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-secret-key',
    { expiresIn: '24h' }
);
```

#### Event-Specific Ticket Scanning (Lines 1755-1757)
```javascript
// Check if ticket is for worker's assigned event
if (booking.event_id !== workerEventId) {
    return res.json({
        valid: false,
        error: 'You can only scan tickets for your assigned event'
    });
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Frontend Tests
- [x] Create Worker modal has event dropdown
- [x] Edit Worker modal has event dropdown  
- [x] Event dropdown populates with available events
- [x] "No event assigned" option available
- [x] Event selection persists in form

### ✅ Backend Tests
- [x] POST /api/admin/workers accepts eventId parameter
- [x] PUT /api/admin/workers/:id accepts eventId parameter
- [x] GET /api/admin/workers returns event_id and event_title
- [x] Worker tokens include eventId
- [x] Ticket scanning restricted to assigned event

### ✅ Integration Tests
- [x] Worker created with event assignment
- [x] Worker updated with different event assignment
- [x] Worker can only scan tickets for assigned event
- [x] Supervisor can only view participants for assigned event

## 🎯 Feature Benefits

1. **Event-Specific Access**: Workers can only scan tickets for their assigned event
2. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to other events' data
3. **Organization**: Clear assignment of responsibilities
4. **Scalability**: Supports multiple events with different workers
5. **Flexibility**: Workers can be reassigned to different events

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Admins:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Workers tab
2. Click "Add Worker" or edit existing worker
3. Select an event from "Assigned Event" dropdown
4. Save worker - they can now only scan tickets for that event

### For Workers:
1. Login with worker credentials
2. Can only scan tickets for their assigned event
3. Cannot access tickets from other events

## 📊 Database Schema

The `workers` table includes:
- `event_id` (UUID, nullable) - References events.id
- Foreign key constraint ensures data integrity
- LEFT JOIN with events table for event titles

## ✅ STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

The worker event assignment feature is **complete and functional** across all system layers. Workers can be assigned to specific events and are restricted to scanning tickets only for their assigned event.
