# 🛠️ UX & Logic Fixes - October 11, 2025

## ✅ **ALL THREE ISSUES FIXED**

---

## 📋 **Issue #1: ISM Student Discount Logic**

### **Problem:**
- UI showed "Non-ISM Student Fee" which was confusing
- Logic added €1 extra for non-ISM students
- Wording implied a penalty rather than a discount for ISM students

### **Solution:**
Changed from "fee for non-ISM" to "discount for ISM students"

### **Changes Made:**

**Frontend (scripts/checkout.js):**
- Changed checkbox hint from "Non-ISM students pay an additional fee" → "ISM students receive a discount"
- Updated price calculation: `const discount = isISMStudent ? 1 : 0;` (was: `const extraFee = isISMStudent ? 0 : 1;`)
- Changed price breakdown label: "ISM Student Discount" in green (was: "Non-ISM Student Fee")
- Shows discount as `-€1.00` for ISM students

**Backend (backend/railway-server.js):**
- Updated calculation: `const discount = isISMStudent ? parseFloat(settings.ism_student_discount) : 0;`
- Changed formula: `totalAmount = (basePrice - discount) * quantity` (was: `(basePrice + discount)`)

**Admin UI (admin/index.html):**
- Changed label: "ISM Student Discount (€)" (was: "Non-ISM Student Fee (€)")
- Updated hint: "Discount amount for ISM students"

**Database (backend/supabase-settings-fix.sql):**
- Updated description to reflect discount concept

### **Result:**
✅ ISM students now see a €1 discount (green, negative amount)  
✅ Non-ISM students see no extra row, just the base price  
✅ Clearer, more positive messaging

## 📋 **Issue #2: Multiple Attendee Information**

### **Problem:**
- When purchasing 2+ tickets, only primary contact info was collected
- No way to specify who the other tickets were for

### **Solution:**
Added dynamic attendee forms that appear when quantity > 1

### **Changes Made:**

**Frontend (scripts/checkout.js):**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Wrapped primary contact in `<div class="form-section">` with title "Primary Contact Information"
   - Added `<div id="additionalAttendeesContainer"></div>` for dynamic forms

2. **New Method - `renderAdditionalAttendees()`:**
   - Renders N-1 attendee cards (where N = ticket quantity)
   - Each card shows: "Attendee 2", "Attendee 3", etc.
   - Fields per attendee:
     - First Name * (required)
     - Last Name * (required)
     - Email (optional)
     - Phone (optional)

3. **Updated Methods:**
   - `increaseQuantity()` → calls `renderAdditionalAttendees()`
   - `decreaseQuantity()` → calls `renderAdditionalAttendees()`
   - `validateForm()` → validates all attendee forms
   - `handleSubmit()` → collects all attendee data into `additionalAttendees` array

4. **Data Collection:**
   ```javascript
   const bookingData = {
       eventId, firstName, lastName, email, phone,
       isISMStudent, quantity,
       additionalAttendees: [
           { firstName, lastName, email, phone },
           // ... for each additional ticket
       ]
   };
   ```

**Styling (styles/checkout.css):**
- Added `.form-section` styles
- Added `.form-section-title` with icon styling
- Added `.attendee-card` with hover effects
- Added `.attendee-title` with bottom border
- Cards have light gray background, rounded borders

### **Result:**
✅ When qty = 1: Only primary contact shown  
✅ When qty = 2: Primary contact + 1 attendee card  
✅ When qty = 3: Primary contact + 2 attendee cards  
✅ Form validation ensures all required fields filled  
✅ Clean, card-based UI for each attendee  
✅ Smooth scroll to first error on validation failure

## 📋 **Issue #3: Payment Instructions Clarity**

### **Problem:**
Too much information, some unnecessary details, unclear warnings

**Old text:**
- Payment Deadline: Monday, October 13, 2025, at 01:09 AM
- Reference Required: Use the exact reference number above in your transfer
- Ticket Delivery: You'll receive your ticket via email within 24 hours after payment confirmation
- No Payment? Your booking will be automatically cancelled after the deadline
- No Ticket? If you don't receive your ticket within 24 hours after transfer, contact support
- Event Entry: A valid ticket is required for event entry

### **Solution:**
Simplified, strengthened key messages, added visual emphasis

**New text:**
- ✅ **Reference Required:** Use the exact reference number above in your transfer
- ✅ **Ticket Delivery:** You'll receive your confirmed ticket via email within 24 hours after payment confirmation. If not, [contact support](#contact)
- ⚠️ **Event Entry:** A valid ticket is required for event entry. **If you did NOT pay for tickets, you will not be let in!**

### **Changes Made:**

**Frontend (scripts/payment-instructions.js):**
- Removed "Payment Deadline" line (deadline already shown in summary)
- Removed "No Payment?" and "No Ticket?" lines (redundant)
- Added clickable "contact support" link
- Added strong warning in red for non-payment consequence
- Added `highlight-warning` class to Event Entry line

**Styling (styles/payment-instructions.css):**
- Added `.info-list li.highlight-warning` styles:
  - Light red background (#fef2f2)
  - Red border (#fecaca)
  - Rounded corners
  - Extra padding
  - ⚠️ warning icon instead of ✓
- Warning text in red (#dc2626) and bold

### **Result:**
✅ Less clutter, more focus on essentials  
✅ Strong visual warning for payment requirement  
✅ Easy access to support via link  
✅ Red highlight box makes entry warning unmissable

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### **Test 1: ISM Discount**

1. Go to event → "Buy Ticket"

5. Try submitting without filling attendee names
6. **Expected:** Validation errors appear, form doesn't submit
7. Fill all required fields
8. **Expected:** Form submits successfully

### **Test 3: Payment Instructions**
