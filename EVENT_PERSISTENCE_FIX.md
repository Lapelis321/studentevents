# Event Persistence Fix - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Events created/deleted in admin dashboard were not showing on the main page  
**Status:** FIXED and DEPLOYED

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
The main page at https://afterstateevents.netlify.app was showing **6 hardcoded demo events** instead of real events from the database. When you created or deleted events in the admin dashboard, the changes didn't appear on the main page.

### Root Cause
The frontend was using `scripts/config.js` which has auto-detection logic for the API URL. On Netlify, this logic was failing to detect the correct production API URL, causing the homepage to:
1. Try fetching from an incorrect URL
2. Receive an error
3. Fall back to displaying mock/demo data

### Solution Applied

#### 1. **Forced Production API URL** (All HTML Pages)
Added inline script override in:
- `index.html`
- `checkout.html`
- `event-details.html`
- `post-payment.html`

```html
<script>
    // Force production API URL for Netlify deployment
    window.API_BASE_URL = 'https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api';
</script>
```

#### 2. **Removed Mock Data Fallback** (`scripts/homepage.js`)
Changed the `loadEvents()` method to:
- ✅ Show error state on API failure
- ❌ NO longer fall back to mock data
- ✅ Added detailed console logging

**Before:**
```javascript
if (response.ok) {
    this.events = await response.json();
} else {
    this.events = this.getMockEvents(); // ❌ Bad!
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (response.ok) {
    this.events = await response.json();
    console.log('✅ Loaded events from API:', this.events.length, 'events');
} else {
    console.error('❌ API returned error:', response.status);
    this.showErrorState(); // ✅ Show error instead
}
```

#### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
All API calls now log:
- `🔍 Fetching events from: [URL]`
- `📡 API Response status: [status code]`
- `✅ Loaded events from API: [count] events`
- `❌ Error messages` (if any issues occur)

#### 4. **Updated Cache Busting**
Changed script versions from `v=3.0.0` to `v=3.0.1` to force browser cache refresh.

## 🧪 How to Test (After Deployment)

### Step 1: Wait for Netlify Deployment
Netlify automatically deploys when you push to GitHub. Wait **2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete.

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Tools
1. Go to https://afterstateevents.netlify.app
2. Press **F12** on your keyboard
3. Click the **"Console"** tab at the top

### Step 3: Refresh the Page
Press **Ctrl+F5** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to hard refresh and clear cache.

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
You should see:
```
=== Homepage Init ===
API Base URL: https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api
Window location: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app/
🔍 Fetching events from: https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/events
📡 API Response status: 200
✅ Loaded events from API: 4 events
```

### Step 5: Verify Event Count
The main page should now show **4 events** (the real ones from your database), not 6 demo events.

### Step 6: Test Event Sync
1. Go to admin dashboard: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app/admin/
2. Create a new test event
3. Go back to main page: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app/
4. **Refresh the page** (or wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh)
5. ✅ The new event should appear!

## 📊 Expected Results

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|----------------|
| Open main page | Shows 4 real events from database |
| Create event in admin | Appears on main page after refresh |
| Delete event in admin | Disappears from main page after refresh |
| Console logs | Shows API calls and event count |
| Network tab | Shows successful call to Railway API |

---

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

If events still don't show:

### Check 1: Console Errors
Look in the Console tab (F12) for any red error messages.

### Check 2: Network Tab
1. Press **F12**
2. Click **"Network"** tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for `events` in the list
5. Click on it
6. Check **"Response"** tab - should show your events as JSON

### Check 3: Railway Backend
Test the API directly:
```
https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```
Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### Check 4: Database Connection
Verify Railway has the correct `DATABASE_URL`:
- Should use: `aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com` (Session mode)
- NOT: `db.vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu.supabase.co` (Direct connection)

- **Pushed to:** `main` branch
- **Auto-deploys to:** Netlify (https://afterstateevents.netlify.app)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Changes committed to git
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Netlify deployment completes (check in 2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Main page shows 4 real events (not 6 demo events)
- [ ] Console logs show successful API calls
- [ ] Creating events in admin reflects on main page

---

## 📝 Next Steps

Once you confirm this fix works:

1. **Test Complete Flow:**
   - Create an event in admin
   - View it on main page
   - Click "View Details"
   - Try to purchase a ticket

2. **Remaining TODOs:**
   - Set up SendGrid for email notifications
   - Test complete purchase flow with Stripe
   - Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase

## 🆘 Need Help?

If the fix doesn't work after waiting 3-5 minutes for deployment:

1. Check the console logs (F12 → Console)
2. Check the network tab (F12 → Network)
3. Share any error messages you see

The console logs will now show exactly what's happening with the API calls, making debugging much easier!
