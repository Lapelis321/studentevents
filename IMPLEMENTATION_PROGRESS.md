## üéØ CURRENT STRATEGY

Given the massive scope, I'm working systematically:

1. **Phase 1 (Critical Fixes)** - Complete foundation features
2. **Phase 3 (Booking Flow)** - High user impact, needed for operations
3. **Phase 2 (Settings)** - Important but can work without temporarily  
4. **Phase 4 (Workers)** - New system, lower immediate priority
5. **Phase 5 (Email/Validation)** - Enhancement to existing flows
6. **Phase 6 (Testing)** - Essential final step

3. ‚è≥ Phase 3: Bookings table updates (primary_contact_type)
4. ‚è≥ Phase 4: Workers table creation
5. ‚è≥ Phase 5: Bookings tickets_validated field

### New Files to Create:
- `rules.html` - Public rules page
- `worker/login.html` - Worker login
- `worker/index.html` - Worker dashboard
- `worker/worker-dashboard.js` - Worker logic
- `worker/worker-dashboard.css` - Worker styles

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REALITY CHECK
