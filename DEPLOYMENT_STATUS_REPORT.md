## ‚ö†Ô∏è FRONTEND (Netlify) - DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

### Deployment Details
- **Platform**: Netlify
- **URL**: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ONLINE BUT OUTDATED CODE**
- **Site ID**: afterstateevents

### Problem
**Netlify is NOT auto-deploying from GitHub pushes.**

### Evidence
1. **Multiple commits pushed to GitHub** (all visible in `origin/main`):
   - `378ae3d` - [FORCE DEPLOY] Netlify build trigger - add timestamp
   - `329f8f0` - URGENT: Force Netlify rebuild - status badges not deployed
   - `5c30e6b` - Force Netlify redeploy - add version comment to homepage.js
   - `690b31b` - Trigger Netlify deployment - update frontend code

2. **Netlify still serving OLD code**:
   - ‚ùå `index.html` - Missing timestamp comment
   - ‚ùå `scripts/homepage.js` - Missing status badge logic
   - ‚ùå No "SOLD OUT" badges visible
   - ‚ùå No "CANCELLED" badges visible
   - ‚ùå Completed events still showing (should be hidden)

3. **Direct file comparison**:
   ```
   LOCAL (scripts/homepage.js):
   - Line 2: // Version: 1.0.3 - Status badges and filtering
   - Line 174-175: Filter out completed events
   - Line 199-200: Check for isSoldOut and isCancelled
   - Line 209-229: Badge rendering logic
   
   NETLIFY (scripts/homepage.js):
   - Line 2: // ===== HOMEPAGE SPECIFIC JAVASCRIPT =====
   - No filtering logic
   - No badge logic
   - OLD VERSION from weeks ago
   ```

## üîß REQUIRED ACTION

### YOU MUST DO THIS MANUALLY:

1. **Log in to Netlify**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com
   - Log in with your account (GitHub/email)

2. **Navigate to your site**
   - Click on "afterstateevents" project
   - Or go directly to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/afterstateevents

3. **Check Deploys Tab**
   - Click "Deploys" in the top navigation
   - Look for:
     - Are there any pending builds?
     - Are there any failed builds?
     - When was the last successful deploy?

4. **Force Manual Deploy**
   - Click "Trigger deploy" button (top right)
   - Select "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete (~1-2 minutes)

5. **Check Build Settings** (if manual deploy doesn't work)
   - Go to: Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy
   - Check "Continuous deployment" section
   - Verify "Auto publishing" is **ENABLED**
   - Check if GitHub webhook is connected

6. **Alternative: Re-link GitHub**
   - If auto-deploy is still not working:
   - Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Link repository
   - Re-authorize GitHub access
   - This will recreate the webhook

## üìù WHAT'S MISSING ON NETLIFY

### Features Not Deployed Yet:
1. **Status Badges**
   - "SOLD OUT" badge for sold-out events
   - "CANCELLED" badge for cancelled events

2. **Event Filtering**
   - Completed events should be hidden from homepage
   - Only active, sold-out, and cancelled events should show

3. **CTA Button Text**
   - Should say "Sold Out" for sold-out events
   - Should say "Event Cancelled" for cancelled events
   - Should say "View Details" for active events

4. **Visual Styling**
   - Sold-out cards should have reduced opacity
   - Cancelled cards should have reduced opacity
   - Badges should have gradient backgrounds (red for sold-out, orange for cancelled)

---

## ‚úÖ LOCAL TESTING CONFIRMATION

All features work perfectly when tested locally:

```bash
# Start backend locally
cd backend
node railway-server.js
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001

# Start frontend locally
cd ..
node frontend-server.js
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:8000
```

### Local Test Results:
- ‚úÖ Status badges appear correctly
- ‚úÖ Completed event "Summer Beach Party 2024" is hidden
- ‚úÖ "VIP Exclusive Gala" shows "SOLD OUT" badge
- ‚úÖ "Tech Career Fair 2025" shows "CANCELLED" badge
- ‚úÖ CTA buttons show correct text
- ‚úÖ API fetching from Railway backend works
- ‚úÖ All styling applied correctly

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT AFTER DEPLOY

2. **Visual indicators**:
   - Red gradient "SOLD OUT" badge on VIP Gala card
   - Orange gradient "CANCELLED" badge on Tech Fair card
   - Reduced opacity on sold-out and cancelled cards

3. **Functionality**:
   - Clicking active events ‚Üí redirects to ticket purchase
   - Clicking sold-out events ‚Üí shows "Sold Out" message
   - Clicking cancelled events ‚Üí shows cancellation info

## üîç GITHUB STATUS

All code is committed and pushed to GitHub:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -5
378ae3d (HEAD -> main, origin/main) [FORCE DEPLOY] Netlify build trigger - add timestamp
329f8f0 URGENT: Force Netlify rebuild - status badges not deployed
5c30e6b Force Netlify redeploy - add version comment to homepage.js
690b31b Trigger Netlify deployment - update frontend code

‚úÖ All commits pushed to `origin/main`  
‚ùå Netlify not detecting new commits

## üí° IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**PRIORITY 1: FIX NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT**
1. Log in to Netlify dashboard
2. Manually trigger deploy
3. Verify deployment completes
4. Test the live site

**PRIORITY 2: VERIFY AUTO-DEPLOY**
1. Make a small test change (e.g., comment in CSS)
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Check if Netlify auto-deploys

**PRIORITY 3: FULL SYSTEM TEST**
Once Netlify deploys:
1. Test homepage event display
2. Test admin dashboard (create/edit/delete events)
3. Test worker scanning page
4. Test ticket purchase flow
5. Verify all features work end-to-end
