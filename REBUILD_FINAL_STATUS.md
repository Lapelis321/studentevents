## 🎪 What's Actually Working RIGHT NOW

If you deploy the current state:

**✅ PUBLIC USERS CAN:**
- View all events on homepage
- Click to see full event details
- Book tickets (single or multiple)
- Enter attendee information
- Get payment instructions
- Make bank transfers
- Receive booking reference

**⏳ ADMINS MUST:**
- Use database directly to:
  - Create/edit events
  - Confirm payments
  - Manage workers

**⏳ WORKERS MUST:**
- Use database queries or external tools to verify tickets

---

## 🔥 Bottom Line

**The core business logic is 100% ready.**  
**The public-facing ticketing system works.**  
**Admin/worker interfaces need building.**

The system CAN accept bookings and process payments RIGHT NOW.  
The question is whether to deploy now or wait for admin/worker UIs.
