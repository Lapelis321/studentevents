## 📋 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations (By Design)
1. **Demo Mode Active**: Real payments require Stripe API keys (user action needed)
2. **In-Memory Database**: Data temporary until DATABASE_URL added (user action needed)
3. **No Email Sending**: Requires SendGrid API key (user action needed)
4. **Test Data**: Using mock events (can create real events in admin panel)

**Note**: All limitations are intentional and await user's API configuration
