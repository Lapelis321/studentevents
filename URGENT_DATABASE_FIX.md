# üö® URGENT: Database Still Has Wrong Data

## Current API Response Shows:
```json
{
  "id": "778b1766-4842-48c4-a423-74b9faa27891",
  "title": "Fux After Party",
  "min_age": null,                    // ‚ùå STILL NULL
  "dress_code": "No specific dress code"  // ‚ùå STILL WRONG
}
```

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:

### Option 1: Use Admin Dashboard (FASTEST)
1. Go to: https://afterstateevents.vercel.app/admin
2. Login: admin@studentevents.com / admin123
3. Go to Events tab
4. Click "Edit" on "Fux After Party"
5. Set:
   - Minimum Age: "18"
   - Dress Code: "Studio 54"
6. Click "Save Changes"

### Option 2: Direct SQL (If you have Supabase access)
```sql
UPDATE events 
SET 
    min_age = 18,
    dress_code = 'Studio 54'
WHERE id = '778b1766-4842-48c4-a423-74b9faa27891';
```

### Option 3: API Update (If you have admin token)
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/events/778b1766-4842-48c4-a423-74b9faa27891" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"minAge": 18, "dressCode": "Studio 54"}'
```

## üéØ Expected Result After Fix:
```json
{
  "min_age": 18,
  "dress_code": "Studio 54"
}
```

## ‚úÖ Verification:
After fixing, the main page should show:
- "18+ years" instead of "undefined+ years"
- "Studio 54" instead of "undefined"

**The frontend code is already fixed - we just need to update the database!**
