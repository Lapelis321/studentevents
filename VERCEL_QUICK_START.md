## 🎯 **What Changed?**

| Before (Netlify) | After (Vercel) |
|------------------|----------------|
| ❌ 503 Error | ✅ Online |
| ❌ Site paused | ✅ Working |
| ❌ Bandwidth limit | ✅ Unlimited |
| URL: `afterstateevents.netlify.app` | URL: `studentevents.vercel.app` |

## 🔄 **Auto-Deployments**

From now on, every time you push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My changes"
git push origin main
```

**Vercel will automatically:**
1. Detect the push
2. Deploy the changes
3. Update your live site (30 seconds)
4. Send you a notification email

---

## ⚙️ **Your Backend Stays The Same**

**Important:** Your backend and database are still on Railway/Supabase:
- ✅ Railway backend: `studentevents-production.up.railway.app`
- ✅ Supabase database: Still connected
- ✅ All API endpoints: Working
- ✅ All fixes we made: Still active

**Only the frontend moved from Netlify → Vercel!**

---

## 📱 **Share Your New URL**

Once deployed, share with users:
- **Live Site:** `https://your-site.vercel.app/`
- **Admin Panel:** `https://your-site.vercel.app/admin/`

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### Tip 1: Add Custom Domain (Optional)
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Click your project
2. Go to "Settings" → "Domains"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `events.yourdomain.com`)

### Tip 2: View Deployment Logs
- Click "Deployments" tab in Vercel
- See all past deployments
- Rollback if needed (one click)

### Tip 3: Get Analytics (Free)
- Vercel includes free analytics
- See page views, load times, etc.
- No setup needed!

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### "Repository not found"
**Fix:** Make sure you authorized Vercel to access your GitHub account

### "Build failed"
**Fix:** Check the build logs - but your site doesn't need a build step, so this shouldn't happen

### "404 Not Found"
**Fix:** Make sure the deployment shows "Completed" status - wait 30 seconds

### "API calls failing"
**Check:** Railway backend status (separate from Vercel)
- Go to: https://railway.app/
- Make sure backend is running

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

You'll know it worked when:

- ✅ Main page loads (no 503)
- ✅ Events show from database
- ✅ Status badges display correctly
- ✅ Event details page works
- ✅ Admin dashboard loads

## 📞 **Next Steps After Migration**
