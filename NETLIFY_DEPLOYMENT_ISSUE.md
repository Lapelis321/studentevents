# Netlify Deployment Issue - Status Badges Not Showing

## Problem
The Netlify site `afterstateevents.netlify.app` is serving **OLD JavaScript code** and not deploying the latest changes from GitHub.

## Evidence
- ✅ Latest code IS in GitHub repository (commit `5c30e6b` and `329f8f0`)
- ✅ `scripts/homepage.js` contains status badge logic locally and in GitHub
- ❌ Netlify is serving old version without status badges
- ❌ File served by Netlify starts with `// ===== HOMEPAGE SPECIFIC JAVASCRIPT =====` (old version)
- ❌ File in GitHub starts with `// ===== HOMEPAGE SPECIFIC JAVASCRIPT =====\n// Version: 1.0.3 - Status badges and filtering` (new version)

## Expected Behavior
The homepage should show:
1. **SOLD OUT** badge on "VIP Exclusive Gala" (sold out event)
2. **CANCELLED** badge on "Tech Career Fair 2025" (cancelled event)  
3. **Hide** "Summer Beach Party 2024" (completed event)
4. CTA buttons should say "Sold Out" and "Event Cancelled" instead of "View Details"

## Current Behavior
- All 4 events showing without status badges
- Completed event is visible (should be hidden)
- All CTAs say "View Details"

## Root Cause
Netlify is **NOT automatically deploying** from GitHub. Possible reasons:
1. Auto-deploy from GitHub is disabled in Netlify settings
2. GitHub webhook to Netlify is not configured
3. Netlify build is failing silently

## Manual Fix Required

### Option 1: Enable Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select the `afterstateevents` site
3. Go to **Site configuration** → **Build & deploy**
4. Under **Continuous deployment**, click **Configure**
5. Ensure "Auto publishing" is **enabled**
6. Check that GitHub repository `Lapelis321/studentevents` is connected
7. Branch to deploy should be: `main`

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select the `afterstateevents` site
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
5. Wait for build to complete (~1-2 minutes)

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Rebuild
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select the `afterstateevents` site
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Clear cache and deploy site**
5. Wait for build to complete

### Option 4: Check Build Logs
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select the `afterstateevents` site
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click on the latest deploy
5. Check build logs for errors
6. If there are errors, fix them and redeploy

## Files Changed (Ready in GitHub)
- `scripts/homepage.js` - Added status badge logic, filtering
- `styles/homepage.css` - Added `.sold-out-badge`, `.cancelled-badge`, `.sold-out`, `.cancelled` styles
- `backend/railway-server.js` - Returns all events with proper status fields
- `admin/admin-api-connector.js` - Handles event status correctly

## Backend Status
✅ **Railway backend is WORKING PERFECTLY**
- URL: `https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app`
- API endpoint: `https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/events`
- Returns 4 events with correct statuses: active, sold-out, cancelled, completed

## Next Steps
**MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED:**
Please log into Netlify and trigger a manual deploy or enable auto-deploy from GitHub.

Once deployed, the homepage will correctly show:
- 3 events (completed event hidden)
- SOLD OUT badge on VIP Exclusive Gala
- CANCELLED badge on Tech Career Fair 2025
- Proper CTA text for each event status
