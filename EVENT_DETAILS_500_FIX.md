# ✅ Event Details 500 Error - FIXED

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Event details page returning 500 Internal Server Error  
**Status:** FIXED and DEPLOYED

---

## 🐛 **Problem**

When clicking on an event to view details, the page showed:
- "Loading event details..." forever
- Console error: `500 (Internal Server Error)`
- API endpoint: `GET /api/events/2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0`
- Page displayed: "Event not found"

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

**File:** `backend/railway-server.js` (line 262)

The backend was trying to parse UUID strings as integers:

```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE - BROKEN CODE:
const eventId = parseInt(req.params.id);
// parseInt('2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0') returns 2571
// Database query: SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = 2571
// Result: No match (because ID is actually a UUID string)
```

**Why This Happened:**
- The original code was written for integer IDs
- Database was later changed to use UUIDs (via `gen_random_uuid()`)
- The `parseInt()` conversion was never updated
- This caused a mismatch: searching for integer `2571` when actual ID was `'2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0'`

---

## 🔧 **Solution**

Removed the `parseInt()` conversion and kept the ID as a string:

```javascript
// ✅ AFTER - FIXED CODE:
const eventId = req.params.id; // Keep as string for UUID support

if (pool) {
  // Use database - ID is a UUID string
  const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = $1', [eventId]);
  if (result.rows.length === 0) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Event not found' });
  }
  res.json(result.rows[0]);
} else {
  // Use in-memory storage - convert to int for legacy support
  const event = inMemoryEvents.find(e => e.id === parseInt(eventId));
  if (!event) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Event not found' });
  }
  res.json(event);
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Remove `parseInt()` for database queries (UUID support)
2. Keep `parseInt()` only for in-memory fallback (legacy support)
3. PostgreSQL handles UUID type correctly when passed as string

## ✅ **Testing & Verification**

### Test 1: Direct API Call ✅
```bash
curl "https://studentevents-production.up.railway.app/api/events/2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0"
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "id": "2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0",
  "title": "after party 2",
  "date": "2025-10-12T18:54:00.000Z",
  "location": "no house",
  "price": "120.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "total_tickets": 123,
  "available_tickets": 123,
  "status": "active",
  ...
}
```
✅ Status 200 - API returns full event data

### Test 2: Event Details Page ✅
- URL: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app/event-details.html?id=2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0
- **Before:** "Event not found" with 500 error
- **After:** Full event details displayed correctly

**Page Shows:**
- ✅ Event title: "after party 2"
- ✅ Date & Time: "Sunday, October 12, 2025 at 09:54 PM"
- ✅ Location: "no house"
- ✅ Price: "€120.00 per ticket"
- ✅ "Buy Ticket" button is functional
- ✅ No console errors

### Test 3: Clicking Event from Main Page ✅
1. Go to main page: https://afterstateevents.netlify.app/
2. Click on any event card
3. Event details load correctly
4. No 500 errors in console

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### PostgreSQL UUID Handling

PostgreSQL's `uuid` type accepts strings and automatically converts them:

```sql
-- Both of these work:
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = '2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0';
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = '2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0'::uuid;
```

The `pg` library (Node.js PostgreSQL client) handles this conversion automatically when using parameterized queries with `$1`.

### Why parseInt() Failed

```javascript
parseInt('2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0')
// Returns: 2571
// (stops parsing at the first non-digit character)

// Then query becomes:
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = 2571
// But the database has:
SELECT * FROM events WHERE id = '2571f42a-5d7b-48e8-a4fc-3fb736df78c0'
// Type mismatch: integer vs uuid → no results → 404/500 error
```

## 📝 **Lessons Learned**

1. **Type Consistency:** When changing database schema from integers to UUIDs, update ALL code that handles those IDs
2. **String IDs:** UUIDs should always be kept as strings, never converted to numbers
3. **API Testing:** Test API endpoints directly (curl/Postman) before debugging frontend
4. **Error Logging:** Add detailed console.error() in catch blocks to diagnose issues faster
