## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Event Edit Button Opens Wrong Modal
**Status:** FOUND  
**Evidence:** Clicked "edit" button, opened "Event Details" view modal instead of edit form  
**Impact:** **Cannot edit events** - blocking admin functionality  
**Location:** `admin/admin-dashboard.js` - button click handlers  
**Root Cause:** Wrong function called or modal not switching to edit mode  

**Fix Required:**
- Check which button is which in action buttons
- First button should open edit modal
- Second button should open view modal
- Verify button order and onclick handlers

---

### 2. Railway Deployment - Need Verification
**Status:** PENDING  
**Evidence:** Fix deployed 10 minutes ago, but not tested yet  
**Impact:** Event edits might still not persist  
**Location:** `backend/railway-server.js` - PUT /api/events/:id  
**Action:** Need to wait for deployment and test once edit modal works  

---

## üü° IMPORTANT ISSUES (Should Fix Soon)

### 3. Event Missing Data Fields
**Status:** LIKELY  
**Evidence:**  
- Event shows "No description provided"
- No "time" field visible (only date)
- Unclear if min_age and dress_code are populated

**Impact:** Events lack important details for users  
**Location:** Event creation/edit form  
**Fields Missing:**
- `time` - Event time separate from date
- `description` - Detailed event description
- `min_age` - Age restriction (showing but might be null)
- `dress_code` - Dress code (showing but might be null)

---

### 4. Email System Configuration Unknown
**Status:** UNVERIFIED  
**Evidence:** No way to test if emails are sending  
**Impact:** Users might not receive ticket emails  
**Location:** Railway environment variables  

**Need to Check:**
- Is `SENDGRID_API_KEY` set in Railway?
- Is `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` configured?
- Are emails actually sending when marking bookings as paid?

**Test:** Mark a booking as paid and check if email arrives

---

### 5. Additional Attendees Display
**Status:** UNVERIFIED  
**Evidence:** Haven't tested multi-attendee bookings  
**Impact:** Additional attendees might not be shown properly  

**Need to Test:**
- Create booking with 2+ attendees
- Check if payment instructions show all attendees
- Verify PDF includes all attendees
- Confirm email has tickets for all attendees

---

## üü¢ MINOR ISSUES (Nice to Have)

### 6. Button Order/Icons Unclear
**Status:** FOUND  
**Evidence:** Three action buttons with only icons, no tooltips visible  
**Impact:** Admin might click wrong button  
**Location:** Events table action buttons  

**Improvement:** Add visible tooltips or labels:
- Button 1: View/Edit (üîç or ‚úèÔ∏è)
- Button 2: ?? (need to identify)
- Button 3: Delete (üóëÔ∏è)

---

### 7. Event Image Display
**Status:** OBSERVED  
**Evidence:** Event details modal shows image  
**Question:** Is image URL required or optional?  
**Impact:** Low - images are nice to have  

---

### 8. Statistics Display
**Status:** OBSERVED  
**Evidence:** Shows "100 Tickets Sold" and "‚Ç¨12,000 Total Revenue"  
**Question:** Are these real or placeholder values?  
**Impact:** Medium - misleading if incorrect  

**Need to Verify:**
- Are ticket counts accurate?
- Is revenue calculation correct?
- Do stats update when bookings change?

---

### 9. Worker Authentication System
**Status:** UNTESTED  
**Evidence:** Worker tab exists but haven't tested worker login  
**Impact:** Unknown if workers can scan tickets  
**Location:** `worker/` directory

## üîß DETAILED FIX PLAN

### Fix #1: Event Edit Button (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** Edit button opens wrong modal

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check button order in `renderEventsTable()`
2. Verify onclick handlers
3. Check if `openEditEventModal()` vs `viewEvent()` 

**Likely Code Location:**
```javascript
// admin/admin-dashboard.js - around line 450
<button onclick="adminDashboard.editEvent('${event.id}')">...</button>
<button onclick="adminDashboard.viewEvent('${event.id}')">...</button>
<button onclick="adminDashboard.deleteEvent('${event.id}')">...</button>
```

**Fix:** Swap functions or fix button order

### Fix #2: Verify Railway Deployment

**Steps:**
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. Wait for "Deployed" status (2-3 minutes)
3. Check logs for errors
4. Once edit modal works, test event editing

---

### Fix #3: Add Event Data Fields

**Missing Fields:**
- `time` field (separate from date)
- Populated `description`
- Optional `min_age` and `dress_code`

**Files to Update:**

- Event edit form
- Database schema (might already exist)
