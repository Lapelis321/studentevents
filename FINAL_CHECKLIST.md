## 📋 **YOUR NEXT STEPS (30 minutes)**

### STEP 1: Run Database Migrations (5 min)

**Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu/sql

**Run these SQL files IN ORDER:**

1. Copy/paste `backend/supabase-settings-table.sql` → Click "RUN"
2. Copy/paste `backend/supabase-bank-transfer-migration.sql` → Click "RUN"

**What this creates:**
- `settings` table (bank details, pricing)
- `bookings` table (customer bookings)

---

### STEP 2: Add Backend API Code (10 min)

1. Open `backend/railway-server.js`
2. Go to line ~280 (after existing event endpoints)
3. Open `BACKEND_API_CODE.md`
4. Copy ALL the code from that file
5. Paste it into `railway-server.js`
6. Save the file

**Then commit and push:**
```bash
git add backend/railway-server.js
git commit -m "Add bank transfer backend API endpoints"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy (~2 minutes)

---

### STEP 3: Test The System (10 min)

**Wait for deployments to complete, then:**

1. **Go to:** https://afterstateevents.vercel.app/
2. **Click** on an event → "Buy Ticket"
3. **Fill** the booking form:
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Email: your-email@example.com
   - Phone: +370 600 12345
   - Check "ISM student" (or not)
4. **Submit** → Should see payment instructions
5. **Check** bank details display correctly

---

### STEP 4: Update Bank Details in Admin (5 min)

**For now, update settings directly in Supabase:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vaoyiepnrizvvqokhcuu/editor
2. Open `settings` table
3. Update these rows:
   - `bank_recipient_name` → Your bank account name
   - `bank_iban` → Your IBAN number
   - `base_ticket_price` → Your price (e.g., 20.00)
   - `ism_student_discount` → Extra fee for non-ISM (e.g., 1.00)

---

## ✅ **WHAT WORKS NOW**

After completing the steps above:

1. ✅ **Customers can:**
   - Browse events
   - Fill booking form
   - Get payment instructions
   - See bank transfer details
   - Download instructions

2. ✅ **System will:**
   - Store bookings in database
   - Generate unique reference numbers
   - Set 24-hour payment deadlines
   - Calculate ISM student pricing

3. ⏳ **Admin needs (manual for now):**
   - Check bank account for transfers
   - Update booking status in Supabase:
     ```sql
     UPDATE bookings 
     SET payment_status = 'paid', paid_at = NOW()
     WHERE payment_reference = 'TICKET-XXXXX';
     ```
   - Manually send tickets (for now)

---

## 🔮 **WHAT'S STILL OPTIONAL**

### Not Critical (Can Add Later):

1. **Admin Settings Page** - Currently update via Supabase
2. **Admin Bookings Dashboard** - Currently view in Supabase
3. **One-Click Payment Confirmation** - Currently manual SQL

These are "nice to have" but the system works without them!

---
