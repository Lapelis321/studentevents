## Current Issue
Your contacts page shows **default values** instead of your saved values because the settings were saved with wrong database keys before the fix was deployed.

## Your Settings (From Admin Panel)
- ‚úÖ Email: `afterstate.events@gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ Phone: `+37063849474`
- ‚úÖ Hours: `Mon - Sun 10:00 - 20:00`

## What Contacts Page Shows (Wrong)
- ‚ùå Email: `support@afterstate.events`
- ‚ùå Phone: `+370 600 00000`
- ‚ùå Hours: `Monday - Friday: 9:00 - 18:00`

## Why This Is Needed

**Before my fix:** Settings were saved with keys like `supportEmail` (camelCase)
**After my fix:** Settings save with keys like `support_email` (snake_case) - matching database schema

**You just need to re-save once** to migrate from the old format to the new format!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Run this SQL in Supabase to check what's in the database:

```sql
-- Check current settings
SELECT key, value FROM settings 
WHERE category IN ('contact', 'organization')
ORDER BY key;
```

This will show if the settings have the correct keys or not.
