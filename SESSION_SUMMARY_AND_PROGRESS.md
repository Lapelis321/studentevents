### Immediate Action Required:

   ```
   This adds:
   - `tickets_available_date` column to `events` table
   - `time` column to `events` table
   - Updated status constraint to include 'coming-soon'

2. **Test Deployed Features:**

3. **Provide Feedback:**

### Decision Point:

**Should I continue implementing the remaining features?**

**Option A: Continue Full Implementation**
- I'll continue systematically through all 14 remaining features
- Est. Time: 50-56 hours
- Result: Complete professional ticketing system

**Option B: Prioritize Core Features Only**
- Focus on Phase 3 (Booking Flow) + Phase 2.1 (Settings)
- Skip: Workers system, advanced features

- Result: Fully functional booking system, advanced features later

**Option C: Pause for Testing**
