## üîç CRITICAL ISSUE: BROWSER CACHE

### Problem
The browser has cached the old JavaScript files. Even though Vercel deployed the new code, the browser continues to load the old cached version.

### Evidence
1. ‚úÖ Deployed file contains new code (verified via fetch)
2. ‚ùå Browser rendering shows old behavior
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Cache-Control headers may not be forcing refresh

### Solutions

#### Solution 1: User Action (Immediate)
**Hard Refresh Browser:**
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

**Or Clear Browser Cache:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

#### Solution 2: Update Version Number (Permanent Fix)
Change version in `index.html` from `v=4.0.0` to `v=4.1.0`:
```html
<script src="scripts/homepage.js?v=4.1.0"></script>
```

This forces browsers to download the new file.
